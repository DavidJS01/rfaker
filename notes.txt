SUPPORTED DATATYPES (FOR MY REFERENCE :D):

- Name
- Address
- SSN

User needs to input:
1. header rows
2. for each row, what datatype 

so this sounds like a good time to use k/v pairs. prob a json doc 

"data_columns": [
    "name": "Name",
    "patient_add": "Address",
    "patient_ssn": "SSN"
] 

preferably this would write to csv (later other formats) in order of provided
input 

like below 
`
name, patient_add, patient_ssn 
fake_name, fake_address, fake_ssn
`
