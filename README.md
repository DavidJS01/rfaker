# rfaker
rfaker is a relational data generator, built in Gleam. The goal of rfaker is to meet the testing needs for your applications that rely on relational data.

Currently, rfaker is in development. It does not build relational datasets, yet.

Eventually, this will be a relational dataset generator with data schemas as a first class citizen. Given a config file, your test dataset will be generated matching the format of your config file.
